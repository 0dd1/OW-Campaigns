% Although the US had to abandon the mine they had already extracted enough Siberite for a substantial research programme.

// Dialogue 1 (Macmillan arrives to the Alpha)
$ D1-JMM-1
- (arrives) Major Macmillan. Powell wanted to speak with me.
$ D1-Sol1-1
- One moment, sir. (enters barracks)
$ D1-Sol1-1a
- (softly) That Macmillan arrived, sir.
$ D1-Pow-1
- (comes outside) Excellent.
$ D1-JMM-2
- (sharply) What's going on, general. (they walk together)
$ D1-Pow-2
- Major, now we have Siberite in our possession but without research facilities it is worthless to us. Your mission is to build a new lab, to be called Epsilon.
$ D1-JMM-3
- But that's a waste of personnel, there's the centre at Alpha...
$ D1-Pow-3
- Don't question my authority Macmillan! Do you think I'm unaware we have facilities here!?
$ D1-JMM-4
- I'm sorry General.
$ D1-Pow-4
- There are too many lives at stake here at Alpha. We don't understand Siberite, and I'm not going to wake up with a base full of dead people because we 'thought it was safe'.
$ D1-JMM-5
- Understood General.
$ D1-Pow-5
- [Joan alive] Just to let you know, Dr. Fergusson will be transferred along with the other scientists, so that might enthuse you to get it done a bit quicker.
$ D1-Pow-5a
- And Major, I know you've had some dealings with the Arab mercenaries...
$ D1-JMM-6
- What about it?
$ D1-Pow-6
- I spoke with their commander, Sheik Abdul...
$ D1-JMM-7
- And?
$ D1-Pow-7
- I've made an agreement with him. Together we can achieve our aims swiftly.
$ D1-JMM-8
- In which area sir?
$ D1-Pow-8
- Joint research on Siberite.
$ D1-JMM-9
- What?
$ D1-Pow-9
- In the group I'm sending there will be four Arab soldiers. You will assist them in constructing their own laboratory and make sure they have sufficient supplies of Siberite to work on.
$ D1-JMM-10
- General...
$ D1-Pow-10
- Is that understood Macmillan?
$ D1-JMM-11
- Understood General.

// Dialogue 2 (when trucks enters scene)
$ D2-Gary-1
- This is insane, why the hell should we help mercenaries, they said themselves they've no allegiance to us.
$ D2-JMM-1
- I've asked myself the same questions Gary. We've just got to trust that the General knows something we don't.
$ D2-Gary-2
- That'll be the day.

// Dialogue 2a (Macmillan meets group of scientists)
$ D2a-Sim-1
- Susanne Simms from the Siberite research programme, at your command Major.
$ D2a-JMM-1
- Glad you all made it.

// Dialogue 2b (continues if Joan present)
$ D2b-Joan-1
- So are we!
$ D2b-JMM-1
- Hey, I've missed you.
$ D2b-Joan-2
- I've missed you more!

// Dialogue 2c (continues if Denis present)
$ D2c-Den-1
- Glad to see you again, captain... I mean lieutenant.
$ D2c-Sim-1
- Don't be mad at him, major. He'll never learn military ranks.

// Dialogue 2c (continues if Khattam present)
$ D2c-JMM-1
- Look, this must be Paul Khattam?
$ D2c-Kha-1
- (replies somehow, but not very warmly)

// Dialogue 3 (after siberite lab and power plants are functional)
$ D3-Sci1-1
- Brilliant, we can finally get to work on siberite.
$ D3-Gary-1
- [present] Siberite, siberite... sometimes I feel you don't realize this is war. What about something useful?
$ D3-Sol1-1
- [otherwise] Hey, shouldn't we try to improve our weapons?
$ D3-Sci1-2
- And what would you want? Should we find out how to construct a F16 from lead pipes and duct tape?
$ D3-JMM-2
- The laser sights would be enough. They should be ready tomorrow for two weeks already.
$ D3-Sci1-3
- You should have thought about it sooner, we'd need an opto lab for it, not this one.
$ D3-Den-3
- [present] I'd like to point out that I've applied for the computer research equipment several times. The Russians have computer controlled vehicles and turrets for ages and we have nothing.
$ D3-FSci2-3
- [otherwise] And what about computers? The Russians have computer controlled vehicles and turrets for ages and we have nothing.
$ D3-Sci2-3
- [otherwise] And what about computers? The Russians have computer controlled vehicles and turrets for ages and we have nothing.
$ D3-JMM-3
- Siberite is of course our priority. But the laser sights would be cool, just as computer controlled turrets.

// Dialogue 3a (during research if Simms present)
$ D3a-Sim-1
- The Major informed me about the fragments of new material. Would it be possible to take a look?
$ D3a-Sci1-1
- Of course.
$ D3a-Sim-2
- I'm sure Peter would be interested.
$ D3a-Sci1-2
- You don't mean the geologist Peter?
$ D3a-Sim-3
- Yeah, why? Do you have a problem with him?
$ D3a-Sci1-3
- Doesn't everyone? He's out of his mind, all that hippy shit - drop your gun and your pants and put a flower up your arse!
$ D3a-Sim-4
- You think believing in peace makes him mad?
$ D3a-Sci1-4
- No, but believing it's possible in this place does.
$ D3a-Sim-5
- (if Joan alive) He's made more progress on Siberite than anyone except Fergusson. I can't see why the General left him out of Epsilon.
$ D3a-Sim-5a
- (if Joan not alive) He's made more progress on Siberite than anyone. I can't see why the General left him out of Epsilon.
$ D3a-Sci1-5
- Maybe Powell's more sceptical about the Arabs than we thought. Knowing Peter if he cracked the structure the first thing he'd do is announce it to the Arabs and the next thing he'd do is tell the Russians.
$ D3a-Sim-6
- Peter's an idealist, he isn't stupid.
$ D3a-Sci1-6
- Simms, if Peter Roth was really smart, he'd never have come to this hell hole would he!?

// Dialogue 4 
$ D4-FSol1-1
- Major, we've sighted a powerful Russian convoy. Here sir. Awaiting your orders sir.

# M3

// Dialogue 5 (when Khattam present, a silent dialog between two Arabs)
$ D5-Ar1-1
- What is wrong with this man? He wears US uniform but he makes his prayers to Allah.
$ D5-Diet-1
- Your great religion reaches the darkest corners of the world Mohammed. Even America!
$ D5-Ar1-2
- You never know, he may want to get closer to his God. We should let Hajii know.
$ D5-Diet-2
- I'll get on the radio now.

// Dialogue 6 (during research)
$ D6-Sci1-1
- Major, I feel awkward saying anything, but...
$ D6-JMM-1
- Tell me what's on your mind Dr.
$ D6-Sci1-2
- The Arabs are supposed to be working with us, but it's clear they tell us nothing of value while we share everything.
$ D6-JMM-2
- Maybe we're just further down the road than them.
$ D6-Sci1-3
- I think there's more to it sir. I don't know what's going on but I just don't trust them.
$ D6-JMM-3
- I can't take action without evidence Dr.
$ D6-Sci1-4
- Which is why I should have kept quiet...
$ D6-JMM-4
- No. You did the right thing. I have the same feelings. We just need a few facts to back them up.

// Dialogue 6b (if Macmillan attack Arabians)
$ D6b-Pow-1
- Macmillan, you've abused your command and made a mockery of the United States Army. An attack on the civilian personnel of an allied power is an unpardonable war crime. You are relieved of your rank and and will face a court martial. Dismissed.

// Dialogue 7 (if Mikhail lives - don't worry, it will be explained inv 7a)
$ D7-Cor-1
- (slowly enters base, exhausted) Who is in charge here?
$ D7-FSol1-1
- Oh God, who's that? Major Macmillan, we've got a visitor, looks like a ghost and wears ragtag US uniform.
$ D7-Sol1-1
- Oh God, who's that? Major Macmillan, we've got a visitor, looks like a ghost and wears ragtag US uniform.
$ D7-Cor-2
- (exhausted) Macmillan? Major? Am I trudging here only to see the bastard promoted again?
$ D7-JMM-2
- Cornell? It can't be true. Mark Cornell? My God, you're alive?
$ D7-Cor-3
- No, you jerk, I came to haunt you. (falls on ground)
$ D7-JMM-3
- Medic, quick. This guy is missing in action for some months now.

// Dialogue 7a (some time after Cornell recovers, when he gets near to John)
$ D7a-JMM-1
- You look awful, Cornell. Wouldn't you care to tell us where you've been while we worked our ass off?
$ D7a-Cor-1
- Yeah, I was a guest in Russian camp. Few weeks ago, I was enjoying daily beatings, torture and other attractions.
$ D7a-JMM-2
- Aha... and why did they let you go? Did you promise to be a good boy?
$ D7a-Cor-2
- I guess they grew tired of torturing me. Besides, they've got a better toy, some Arabian mercenary. Quite a nice girl she was when they first brought her in. (this is reference to Arabian campaign)
$ D7a-JMM-3
- Are you trying to say they let you go?
$ D7a-Cor-3
- No, they tried to kill me.
$ D7a-JMM-4
- And?
$ D7a-Cor-4
- [Cornell met Mikhail in mission 3] Do you remember Mikhail Berezov? The Russian who kept talking about him being friend of America, he escaped during our breakthrough. Well, he let me escaped the night before my execution..
$ D7a-Cor-4a
- [Mikhail has fled or if he was never captured] Do you know some Mikhail Berezov? He asked me if I know you. He said you saved his life once, when he arrived here. He let me escaped the night before my execution. He told me to pass greetings.
$ D7a-JMM-5
- Oh so, Mikhail. I hope they didn't find out about him.
$ D7a-Cor-5
- Bastard! I thought it will be all over for me in the morning and instead I appeared in wilderness, hungry and beaten. Several weeks of root diet did nothing to get me back to shape. I'm sorry John, but I'm not going to be of great help. I'm glad to be alive.
$ D7a-JMM-6
- Get back into shape as soon as you can, man.

// Dialogue 8 (Arabians attack)
$ D8-Sol1-1
- The Arabs are attacking sir. I repeat, the Arabs are attacking us.
$ D8-Sci1-1
- Their Scientists are trying to get to their armoury.
$ D8-JMM-1
- Calling all units. The Arabs have attacked. All Arab military are now considered hostile. Seek and destroy.

# M4
Add secondary arabs
- Kill renegade Arab scientists.

// Dialogue 8a (Arabians attack)
$ D8a-Gary-1
- I knew it from the start Major, joining forces was a lousy gamble.

// Dialogue 8b (after Arabian attack)
$ D8b-Sol1-1
- Where the fuck are you going Paul?
$ D8b-FSol1-1
- Where the fuck are you going Paul?
$ D8b-Kha-1
- They need me more than you.
$ D8b-Sol1-2
- You're joining the Arabs after what they've done.
$ D8b-FSol1-2
- You're joining the Arabs after what they've done.
$ D8b-Kha-2
- I fight them, I fight my own people, my own God. You can shoot me if you want to. I will only go to Allah sooner.
$ D8b-Sol1-3
- You're wrong, but you're still my friend. Go if you're going. But you're making a big mistake.
$ D8b-FSol1-3
- You're wrong, but you're still my friend. Go if you're going. But you're making a big mistake.
$ D8b-Kha-3
- Take care.
$ D8b-Sol1-4
- Get the fuck out of here.
$ D8b-FSol1-4
- Get the fuck out of here.

// Dialogue 9a (if player knows about time-space and slowdown grenades from previous mission)
$ D9a-Cyrus-1
- [present] Shit. Sir, the Russians are using those new fucking bazookas. Fuck the siberite!
$ D9a-Sol1-1
- [otherwise] Sir, it seems the Russians are using that special bazooka ammunition the mercenaries were speaking about.

// Dialogue 9b (if player doesn't know)
$ D9b-Cyrus-1
- [present] Oh shit. Sir, the Russians are using some fucking new bazookas. If they hit somebody he is completely defenceless for a moment. Or he is suddenly transported somewhere. Or everything's fucked up.
$ D9b-Sol1-1
- [otherwise] Sir, it seems the Russian bazookers use some special new ammunition. It somehow warps the space-time - it slows down time, deforms the space and God knows what more.

// Dialogue 9c (continues)
$ D9c-JMM-1
- To all units. Watch the Russian bazookas. They can bring about strange space-time dislocations.
$ D9c-JMM-1a
- [laser sights researched] Our snipers should try to take out bazookers first. Repeat, finish the bazookers first.
