! Selection
Unit control
For the time being you can control only one character, lieutenant John Macmillan. You can select him by left clicking. Above him, you can see a bar that indicates his condition.

You can issue orders to selected unit - if you right-click a place your order your character to move there. Right-clicking an enemy is order to attack; let's hope you will not need it now.

// Dialogue 1R (Russian patrol)
$ D1R-Rus1-1
- 	(Russian, with Native titles) The signal comes from the hill.
$ D1R-Rus2-1
- 	(Russian, with Native titles) Quick before he moves.

// Dialogue 1Ra (moment later, if the Russian arrive at spot and don't see anyone)
$ D1Ra-Rus2-1
- 	(Russian, with Native titles) Too late! The bastard is gone.
$ D1Ra-Rus2-1a
- 	(Russian, with Native titles) He'll never get through the front line. He lives now, but not for long.

// Dialogue 1Rb (only if Russian patrol spots MacMillan and starts to shot him)
$ D1Rb-Rus1-1
- 	(Russian, with Native titles) Look, he is there!
$ D1Rb-Rus2-1
- 	(Russian, with Native titles) Shoot him.

// Dialogue 1Rc (after 1Rb, if MacMillan runs away and patrol lost him)
$ D1Rc-Rus1-1
- 	(Russian, with Native titles) Shit! The bastard is gone.
$ D1Rc-Rus2-1
- 	(Russian, with Native titles) He'll never get through the front line. He lives now, but not for long.

! Visibility
Visibility
Your character can only see what is displayed in light colours. You know the greyed-out bits of map, but you cannot see them so you cannot know if there is an enemy. You know next to nothing about the black parts of map.

Note the enemy at the fringe of your visual range: they cannot see you but you can them. You are standing on higher ground and therefore you have longer range of sight. Try to make an advantage of it during the game.

// Dialogue 2 (when John finds a medium wounded American)
$ D2-Bobby-1
- 	No, please!
$ D2-JMM-1
- 	What happened?
$ D2-Bobby-2
- 	I stepped through the EON and the first thing I knew I was being shot at.
$ D2-JMM-2
- 	Who were they?
$ D2-Bobby-3
- 	I didn't wait to find out.
$ D2-JMM-3
- 	You've been hit, you need treatment.
$ D2-Bobby-4
- 	Go ahead, call a hospital?
$ D2-JMM-4
- 	We've got to find Alpha base. 
$ D2-Bobby-5
- 	Have you made contact yet?
$ D2-JMM-5
- 	Just about. All they said was keep our heads down.
$ D2-Bobby-6
- 	And then what?
$ D2-JMM-6
- 	You tell me.

! selection2
Controlling more units
Now you have another character, Bobby Brandon. If you left-click him, you will select him instead of Macmillan and all orders will be issued to him.

If you have a unit selected you can hold down Shift and left-click another one - then you will have both selected. You can also hold down left mouse button and drag a marquee about units you want to select.

[multiple selection]
!

! healthbar
Unit lives
A bar above a selected unit shows its condition - if it suffers damage, the bar gets shorter. While the bar is green, the character is healthy or only little wounded and he heals slowly. 

When the bar is yellow, the character is medium wounded. Its state is stabilised but he or she will not heal without medical assistance.

Red bar means that the character's state is critical. He or she lies unconscious on ground and slowly is dying. If you have no medic to stop bleeding and give some immediate assistance to increase the character's condition at least to yellow range, the character will surely die.

// Dialogue 2a (in a small valley)
$ D2a-JMM-1
- 	I think there is no way how to climb anywhere from this valley.
$ D2a-Bobby-1
- 	[present] But we can hide here for a while.

// Dialogue 3 (some five minutes into mission and triggered for faster players)
$ D3-Pow-1
- 	(very weak and noisy voice over radio) If you can hear us, keep together.  We believe there are three of you in the area.  Head Northeast., repeat Northeast and we'll try to get you out of there.
$ D3-JMM-1
- 	(into radio) Hello?
$ D3-Pow-2
- 	Keep to the long grass, avoid the roads or you'll be seen.
$ D3-JMM-2
- 	What the hell's going on. Who are you?
$ D3-Pow-3
- 	Commander Powell, Don't waste any time. They're tracing the radio signals so keep moving. Use the radio again and you're finished.

! crawling
Crawling
Soldiers can crawl. Select them and click the Crawl icon on command panel (or press C) If you want a soldier to stand up again, click icon Walk (or press W). 

A prone soldier is much less visible than the standing one but he is also very slow. You can hide your soldiers by ordering them to crawl but if they are discovered and have to run, definitely order them to stand up first.

! terrain
Terrain types
When you right-click a spot on map, selected characters will try to get there. They avoid obstacles like trees and impassable terrain - rocks and steep hills. 

If you want to know if a terrain is passable or not, you can select a character and click the Move icon on command panel (or press M). The cursor will change shape and waits until you click somewhere. While you move it over terrain, it shows you whether this place is passable or not.
