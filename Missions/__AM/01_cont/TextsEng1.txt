! Visibility
Terén a viditelnost
Tvoje postava vidí jenom to, co je zobrazeno svìtle. Tmavì zobrazené kousky mapy zná, ale nevidí je, takže neví, jestli je na nich nìjaký nepøítel. O èerných oblastech neví vùbec nic.

Povšimni si nepøátel na hranici tvé viditelnosti: oni tì ještì nevidí, zatímco ty je ano. To proto, že stojíš na kopci - výše položená jednotka dohlédne dále. Zkus toho ve høe využívat.
