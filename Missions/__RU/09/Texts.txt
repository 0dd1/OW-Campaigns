- (into radio) Understood, comrade colonel. We will ensure the base is the pride of every Russian soldier.

// Dialogue QrMerc#2 
$ DQrMerc#2-Bur-1
- (into radio) Colonel Popov, some fugitives from Arabian camp offer me their services in exchange for the prisoner. What is your view?
$ DQrMerc#2-Pop-1

$ DQrMerc#2-Bur-2
- All right Kurt, you have a deal.

// Dialogue QrMerc#3

$ DMercAttack-Krt-1

// Dialogue LegionFormed (some time after Heike was released)
$ DLegionFormed-Hke-1
- This is Heike Steyer, comrade commander.
$ DLegionFormed-Bur-1
- What do you want Heike? Did you miss us!?
$ DLegionFormed-Hke-2
- I am now part of the Legion, a group of disenchanted mercenaries. We are now, what you might call 'independent'.

- Don't push it Heike. The Red Army does not hire mercenaries to fight it's battles. Just be glad we let you live.

// Dialogue FiringRange (sometime during mission)
$ DFiringRange-Kuz-1
- [present: alt a1] Comrade commander, we must make every bullet count now. A firing range would improve our shooting skills.
$ DFiringRange-Obl-1
- [otherwise: alt a2] Comrade commander, to beat Yanks we must improve shootings skills. We could build a gallery.
$ DFiringRange-Bur-1
- It is true, the harder the practice the easier the battle. What do you have in mind?
$ DFiringRange-Kuz-2
- [alt a1] We can use this area (camera pans)... and barrels from the depot for targets.
$ DFiringRange-Obl-2
- [alt a2] We could use this area (camera pans)... and barrels from depot for targets. I think our other comrades will be pleased.

// Dialogue Hunting 
$ DHunting-Bel-1
- [alive: alt a1] Comrade, hunting would be good practice for battle.
$ DHunting-Kar-1
- [alive: alt a2] Our work here is almost complete, comrade commander. We could go hunting for target practice.
$ DHunting-Koz-1
- [alive: alt a3] Between us we have built the most magnificent base, comrade Gorky. I suggest we reward ourselves with recreation - hunting! It's also good target practice for the soldiers.
$ DHunting-Bur-1
- I suppose it is possible.
$ DHunting-Bel-2
- [alt a1] There's plenty of game here. And it's more fun than the firing range!
$ DHunting-Kar-2
- [alive: alt a2] There's plenty of game around here. I for one would like to try.
$ DHunting-Koz-2
- [alive: alt a3] There are woods here with wild animals. And we could put some decent food on the table! What do you say?

// Query Hunting
? QHunting
Your men would like to go hunting. Will you let them?
-1 Yes.
-2 No.
?

// Dialogue FreeTime 
$ DFreeTime-Pet-1
- [alive: alt a1] Comrade Gorky, I am exhausted. I request temporary leave!
$ DFreeTime-Kir-1
- [alive: alt a2] Comrade commander, we've been working many hours, and I cease to be efficient now. Could I take a temporary leave?
$ DFreeTime-Kap-1
- [otherwise: alt a3] Comrade commander, the results of research are fascinating. The possibilities are endless. But I am too exhausted to work quickly now. May I take temporary leave? Not for long I promise!
$ DFreeTime-Kuz-1
- [alive: alt b1] Comrade commander, excuse me for a minute, will you? I... er, I have a pressing business to attend to.
$ DFreeTime-Gny-1
- [alive: alt b2] I would like to request temporary leave also, comrade commander. Would it be possible?
$ DFreeTime-Tit-1
- [alive: alt b3] Burlak, do you think you can do without me for a short while now? I'll be back soon.
$ DFreeTime-Obl-1
- [alive: alt b4] Comrade commander, I respectfully ask for temporary leave. Is it OK with you, comrade Gorky?

// Query FreeTime
? QFreeTime
Some of your people would like to take a short break. Will you let them?
-Yes.
-No.
?

// Dialogue QrFreeTime#1 
$ DQrFreeTime#1-Bur-1
- All right, you two. But not for long!

// Dialogue QrFreeTime#2 
$ DQrFreeTime#2-Bur-1
- Is our work here finished? No. When it is, we can rest, not before.

// Dialogue Masha (when objective Weapon is completed)
$ DMasha-Koz-1
- Comrade major, we now have many kinds of weapons produced. We would like you to select a vehicle as your own. It will bring hope to our soldiers when they know you are present. It will also strike fear in the enemy.

// Query Masha
? QMasha
Your men think that you should have a unique vehicle. Try those that are available and the one you enter last before the end of the mission will become your personal carrier from now on.
-OK
?

// Dialogue Masha2 
$ DMasha2-Bur-1
- (moved) Thank you comrades. I hope I won't disappoint you. My tank will be called Masha and always be in the frontline!

// Dialogue AI 
$ DAI-Sch-1
- [alive: alt a1] Comrade commander, the Americans use a computer to drive their vehicles. I've explored this and have a working prototype ready.
$ DAI-Kap-1
- [otherwise: alt a2] Comrade commander, I've noticed the Yanks developed vehicles that drive themselves, using computers. I've tried to do the same and prototype is now ready.
$ DAI-Bur-1
- How good it is?
$ DAI-Sch-2
- [alt a1] A lot better than the Yankee crap, but not nearly as good as vehicle driven by mechanic. I am sure we can improve it.
$ DAI-Kap-2
- [alt a2] Not so good, I am afraid, but not expensive either. It could be better with a little more work.

// Dialogue SpontTelep 
$ DSpontTelep-Sch-1
- [alive: alt a1] (v. excited) Comrade commander! We've made tremendous discovery. We can force the Alaskite to transport large objects great distances
$ DSpontTelep-Kap-1
- [otherwise: alt a2] Comrade commander, we've discovered a completely new property of Alaskite. When stimulated correctly it can transport large objects considerable distance.
$ DSpontTelep-Bur-1
- Could we send tanks into enemy base?
$ DSpontTelep-Sch-2
- [alt a1] Not yet, maybe later. For now we can get broken vehicles out of enemy fire. Many lives are lost trying to repair them during battle. We call this spontaneous transportation - requires only small device.
$ DSpontTelep-Kap-2
- [alt a2] Ah, we are not quite there yet. But I observed drivers being killed repairing their vehicles in the middle of battle. So I devised simple device to move vehicle out of combat, we call this spontaneous transportation.
$ DSpontTelep-Bur-2
- Sounds excellent. I would like to try it.

// Dialogue AmAttackStart (when all mission objectives are completed)
$ DAmAttackStart-Pop-1
- (over radio) Your task is almost finished Gorky, but there are Yanks heading your way. Show them what the Red Army can do!
$ DAmAttackStart-Bur-1
- [MercPaid = True: alt a1] Here come the Americans. Seems as though Legion aren't as good as they think.
$ DAmAttackStart-Glb-1
- [alive, reply] I knew it. Dealing with mercenaries is always a bad idea. You lost 50 crates for nothing!
$ DAmAttackStart-Bur-2
- [MercPaid = False: alt a2] Here are the Americans. (quiet) Come on Yanks, we are waiting for you.

// Dialogue AmAttackFin 
$ DAmAttackFin-Bel-1
- [alive: alt a1] I hope they enjoyed their visit to L. D. Trotsky.
$ DAmAttackFin-Gny-1
- [alive: alt a2] They learnt what Trotsky stands for. Victory over imperialist bastards!
$ DAmAttackFin-Tit-1
- [alive: alt a3] So the base is baptised by blood.
$ DAmAttackFin-Lip-1
- [alive: alt a4] So the first attack on our new base is over. And we are victorious!
$ DAmAttackFin-Kar-1
- [alive: alt a5] The base is no virgin any more!
$ DAmAttackFin-Obl-1
- [alive: alt a6] That was the first attack. There will be more.  We can count on it.
$ DAmAttackFin-Bur-1
- [alive: alt a7] Victory is ours. Thank you, comrades. This base must never be taken.
