@ Hunting grounds
% Not everything is running to plan. When Burlak arrived he found himself alone, some of his comrades are still missing and others are already dead. Better news is  that the struggle against the Americans is going well. It is a struggle in which Burlak will soon play an active role.

// Dialogue  

// Dialogue 1 (immediately after the start of the mission - in S. M. Kirov base)
$ D1-Kur-1
- So you are the one they call, Burlak?
$ D1-Bur-1
- Yes, comrade commander!
$ D1-Kur-2
- I am impressed Burlak.  We need lads like you, who keep calm under fire. We also need good mechanics. You are good?
$ D1-Bur-2
- I hope so comrade commander.
$ D1-Kur-3
- We shall soon learn. I am transferring you to L. P. Beria - this is the base where we produce our vehicles. Private Kovalyuk will come with you, he is also mechanic. Is this clear?
$ D1-Bur-3
- Yes, comrade commander!
$ D1-Kur-4
- Good. Then get moving. Commander of Beria is comrade major Platonov. Report to him.
$ D1-Kur-4a
- [Gnyevko alive] And you can take comrade corporal Gnyevko with you. He would be a little lost without you I think.

# M1
Add Main Beria
- Reach the L. P. Beria Base.

// Dialogue 1a (if Burlak returns to Kirov)
$ D1a-Kur-1
- [without vehicle] Burlak? What are you doing here boy? Didn't I tell you to go to Beria? Report to comrade major Platonov at once!
$ D1a-Kur-1a
- [with a vehicle (after he delivered the first one)] Burlak? We don't need any more vehicles. Do something useful boy!

// Dialogue 1b (Burlak tries to go North before he gets to Beria)
$ D1b-Kov-1
- [alive] We are too far North, Burlak. We must return. (In-game video, moving south)
$ D1b-Bur-1
- [otherwise] I'm too far North already, I must head south. (In-game video)

// Dialogue 2 (upon arrival to Beria)
$ D2-Sol1-1
- Halt! Identify yourself!
$ D2-Bur-1
- Mechanic third class, Yuri Burlak reporting for duty, comrade officer! My orders are to report to comrade major Platonov.
$ D2-Sol1-2
- Fine. I think he is expecting you.
$ D2-Pla-2
- (when Burlak comes closer to the centre of the base) Comrade Gorky, I presume.
$ D2-Bur-2
- That is correct, comrade major! Reporting for duty!
$ D2-Pla-3
- Good. Welcome to Beria. Shipments arrive often in this vicinity comrade, so this is where we build vehicles instead of taking material to Kirov first.
$ D2-Bur-3
- Makes good sense major.
$ D2-Pla-4
- (correcting) Comrade Major. Are you ready to commence your undertaking comrade Gorky.
$ D2-Bur-4
- I am comrade Major.
$ D2-Pla-5
- Good. But before you can begin playing with engines you must construct a design centre and a small workshop. Quickly comrade Gorky.

// Query MoreInfo (use selective query for the next two dialogues)
? QMoreInfo
Do you want to ask major Platonov some questions?
-1 Enquire further about the "shipments"
-2 Enquire further about the "shop"
-3 Enquire further about the "design centre"
-4 No questions. You have all the answers yourself!
?

// Dialogue 2a (QMoreInfo-1)
$ D2a-Bur-1
- Excuse me comrade major, but what are the 'shipments'?
$ D2a-Pla-1
- I forget you are new Burlak. (as if telling a child a story) Let me explain...everything here was built using supplies our army sends through TAWAR. Sometimes you can hear a blast or see a flash. This means a shipment, maybe materials, maybe people, has just arrived in the locality. There's no way to know where or when the next landing will occur but the frequency is greater here than near Kirov. Hence the importance of Beira. (Query MoreInfo appears, with options 2-4)

// Dialogue 2b (QMoreInfo-2)
$ D2b-Bur-1
- Excuse me, comrade major, how do I build this workshop?
$ D2b-Pla-1
- You extract a quantity of material from the depot and get working. There should be enough supplies to keep you going. (Query MoreInfo appears, with options 1 and 3-4)

// Dialogue 2c (QMoreInfo-3)
$ D2c-Bur-1
- I am sorry, comrade major, what kind of design centre?
$ D2c-Pla-1
- Dear me Gorky, I can tell initiative is not your middle name! Call it what you like, design centre, laboratory, it's all the same. A work space to do a little ruminating! You must devise plans before you build or your vehicle may not make it beyond the workshop!

// Dialogue 3 (in any case)
$ D3-Pla-1
- Very well. Now I am now going to search for shipments. I'll get back to you when you have completed your endeavours.
$ D3-Bur-1
- Thank you, comrade major. I shall start work immediately.

- Then what are you waiting for Gorky. Get a move on.

// Dialogue 7b (Both workshop and lab ready, oil engine researched)

$ D13-Bel-1
- Comrade colonel Kurin, we've spotted another new arrival. We're going to test our new vehicle on the stupid yank.
$ D13-Kur-1
- Go ahead Belkov, hit him with all you've got.

$ D14-ASol1-1
- (appears from behind couple of trees South of Russians) Guess what comrades? Surprise! (A group of more soldiers hiding around the place gets up and opens fire.)
$ D14-Bel-1
- It's trap! It's trap! Retreat North! (Returns fire and drives toward forest, when he gets there, his vehicle is on fire. He gets out and goes into forest. Other R. soldiers follow. American mechanic comes to damaged vehicle, repairs it and captures it.)
$ D14-Bel-1a
- Comrade colonel, we're trapped by superior American force! Many here.  Send help! Now! Now!
$ D14-Kur-1
- Restrain yourself comrade! There is no such thing as superior American force. Regroup and attack!
$ D14-Bel-2
- But...
$ D14-Kur-2
- You heard the order! Follow it! Follow it! Quickly!

// Dialogue 14a (Can Burlak help?)
$ D14a-Bur-1
- Comrade major, we are now in a position to help comrade Belkov, should we...
$ D14a-Pla-1
- (cold, terse) Comrade Belkov and his men are no concern of mine! They are under comrade Kurin's orders!
$ D14a-Bur-2
- But....
$ D14a-Pla-2
- (snapping)Shut up Gorky! There may be more American forces in this area. Your task is to locate them and you will not be diverted from it. Do you understand?
$ D14a-Bur-3
- Comrade Major they will....
$ D14a-Pla-3
- (shouts) Do you understand?
$ D14a-Bur-4
- Yes, comrade major.
$ D14a-Pla-4
- Good. Then continue with your mission. If you make contact with the enemy, inform me and I shall consider giving permission to attack.

// Dialogue 15 (New American breastwork is spotted or fires at them)
$ D15-Bur-1
- What!? This was not here earlier!
$ D15-Gny-1
- [present] The Yankees are sly, Burlak. They will have built it quickly.
$ D15-Kov-1
- [otherwise] They will have built it just to stop us reaching Belkov.
$ D15-Bur-2
- [never been on western ridge] There might be a better way than frontal attack here.
$ D15-Kov-2
- [reply] Like what?
$ D15-Bur-3
- [reply] We should see if there is a way to get there from West.

// Dialogue 16 (When Eastern American breastwork is spotted)
$ D16-Kov-1
- [W. bw. not spotted: alt a1] So this is where the Yanks are hiding.
$ D16-Kov-1a
- [W. bw. spotted: alt a2] So they've got another little hiding spot here.
$ D16-Bur-1
- That looks like a good place to build fortifications.
$ D16-Gny-1
- [present] Sure, looks well armoured.

// Dialogue 16A (attack on e. bw. from below)
$ D16A-Gny-1
- [present: alt a1] What are you doing, Burlak? We can't take it out from here!
$ D16A-Kov-1
- [otherwise] Burlak, comrade Major said to chart the territory, maybe we should follow orders?
$ D16A-Bur-1
- There is no other way to destroy this. And I'm not leaving this bunker to attack our comrades every time they come near.

// Query AttackBw (only if: i. Western bw. was spotted; ii. Burlak entered the upper ridge; and iii. QAttackAm didn't take place)

It might be possible to attack the American position from here, but your order specifically asked for reconnaissance only. What are you going to do?
-1 Ask for permission to attack
-2 Ask for reinforcements to attack
-3 Handle the situation yourself, do not communicate with base.

// Dialogue 17 (QAttackBw-1)

$ D17-Pla-1
- (over radio) Eager to be a hero, aren't you, Burlak?
$ D17-Bur-2
- (into radio) We have a very good position, comrade major. We can pick them off easily and aid comrade Belkov and his men.
$ D17-Pla-2
- (over radio) Very well, comrade Gorky. Permission granted.

// Dialogue 18 (QAttackBw-2)
$ D18-Bur-1
- (into radio) This is Yuri Gorky, calling Beria. I think we found an opening in American defences. Could we have reinforcements to assist an attack.
$ D18-Pla-1
- (over radio) Trying to play the hero, are you, Burlak. Your job is establishing Yanks position, not making yourself into a martyr.
$ D18-Bur-2
- (into radio) We are in very good position here. We just need backup.
$ D18-Pla-2
- (over radio) Very well, comrade, I'll send you somebody.

// Dialogue 19 (immediately after Dialogue 17 or 18 or if QAttack-3, when Burlak attacks fortifications)
$ D19-Gny-1
- [present: alt a1] Are you crazy Burlak? You will get us all killed!
$ D19-Bur-1
- [reply] Do you want our boys charging from below and getting slaughtered like Pokryshkin? We can take it out from here, nice and clean.
$ D19-Kov-1
- [otherwise: alt a2] You have balls like a bull, Burlak! And a big one at that!
$ D19-Bur-2
- [reply] This is only matter of brains. Yanks are so stupid they have built a bunker there just so we can take it to pieces.

// Dialogue 19A (attack on w. bw. from below, query AttackBW didn't take place)
$ D19A-Gny-1
- [present: alt a1] What are you doing, Burlak? This is stupid idea!
$ D19A-Kov-1
- [otherwise] This does not seem good tactics, Burlak. Isn't there a better way?

// Dialogue 25 (When Burlak returns to Beria)
$ D25-Pla-1
- So what did you learn or your little journey, boys?
$ D25-Bur-1
- [Both American breastworks found] We found two Yankee bunkers in this area, comrade major. Both are armoured, one is on that knoll to East, and would be difficult to attack, the another is on that ridge just North of here.
$ D25-Bur-1a
- [Eastern American bw. found] We found only one Yankee bunker in this area, comrade major, on that knoll to East. It would be very hard to attack.
$ D25-Bur-1b
