@ Hunting grounds
% Not everything went according to plan. Burlak appeared alone, some of his comrades did not arrive yet, while others are already dead, killed in action. However, it appears that the struggle against American usurpers is going on well and soon Burlak will be able to play more active role in it.

$ D2-Bur-2
- Yes, comrade major! Reporting for duty!
$ D2-Plat-3
- Very well, comrade. This place is favoured by arrival of shipments, so we decided to build vehicles here instead of transporting material to Kirov. So you will have to build yourself some design centre, a little shop and then get to work.

$ D2a-Bur-1
- With your leave, comrade, did you mention arrival of shipments?
$ D2a-Plat-1
- You must be new around here, I guess. All you can see here was build using shipments our army sends us through TAWAR. Occasionally, you can hear a blast or see a flash. This means a crate of shipment - or one of our guys or Yanks - just arrived. There is no way of telling where or when the next shipment is going to land but we observed that more of them appear here than around Kirov. (Query MoreInfo appears, with options 2-4)

// Dialogue 2b (QMoreInfo-2)
$ D2b-Bur-1
- Excuse me, comrade, what kind of shop do you mean?

$ D2c-Bur-1
- I beg your pardon, comrade major, what kind of design centre?
$ D2c-Plat-1
- Well, the eggheads like to call it a laboratory, but it's hardly more then a place where you put together some blueprints you need in the workshop. You won't be able to get any engines running if you don't do this little research first.

! Base
Base

You are now more or less in charge of your first base - comrade major Platonov will give you orders but you have some leeway in executing them. It is therefore important to know how bases work.

The most important building in base is the depot. This is the heart of your base and if you lose it you might as well loose the whole base. All your supplies are stored there and all buildings (e.g. workshops) draw their resources from here. Therefore all other buildings have to be built within certain distance from the depot.

In the upper right corner of the screen you can see a bar showing supplies of material, oil and siberite in depot. It also shows level of power supply and power consumption but we need not to concern us with them now.

[Depot] [Base]
!

! Depot
Depot

Depot is the most important building in your base as it stores the resources in your base and also serves as the power central. If the depot is damaged or destroyed, all buildings that require power or resources will cease to operate.

You can change the profession of your men to engineers inside depot - you simply send one of them inside and then click Change to Engineer icon. Then click Exit building icon or right-click anywhere on the map and new engineer will leave the building.

[Depot] [Base]
!

! Construction
Construction buildings

In order to build anything you need to have engineers. Send yourself and/or any other men into depot and click "Change to engineer" button. Then order your men out (either right-click anywhere on map or click "Exit Building" button).

Now select an engineer and click Build icon (or press B). Then choose a building you want to construct. You will see a shape of the selected building - move it around the map until you find a place where you want to place it. Use right mouse button to rotate the building  (please note green arrows pointing to its entrances - rotation of the building is important). Use the left mouse button to confirm building.

If the mock building turns red, you cannot build it on that place (probably because it is too far from depot or because the terrain is too uneven there).

// Dialogue 4 (When shipment appears and Platonov spots it)
$ D4-Plat-1
- Comrade Burlak, I've spotted some shipments here. Come over here or send somebody to pick them up! (There should only be enough material for one vehicle at first, so that the player cannot produce more vehicles while he gives the first one to Belkov and his boys.)

! GatheringMaterial
Gathering Material

The material sent from future by your comrades (familiarly know as "cans" because of uncanny American habit to include cans of Coke in these shipments) appears as plain wooden crates across the map. In order to make use of them, you have to transport them into your depot. Select one of your engineers (if you don't have one, you have to change the profession of one of your men - se [Professions]) and right-click a crate. The engineer will go there, pick up the crate, take it to the depot, return for another crate, and so on until all crates are carried away. There may be a maximum of five crates on one spot.

// Dialogue 5a (Lab finished)
$ D5a-Bur-1
- Comrade major, the lab is up and running. We shall now proceed with your orders.

$ D6-Plat-1
- What do you think you are doing, comrade Gorky?! Did I order you to build this? Please, get it through your head that it is my orders that get carried out on this base!
$ D6-Bur-1
- (engineer abandons building, it is destroyed, material is returned to depot) I am sorry, comrade major! It will not happen again.

// Dialogue 7a (Both workshop and lab ready, oil engine not researched)
$ D7a-Bur-1
- Now we have all the facilities we need, comrade major! But we won't be able to fit these vehicles with any engine until we make some experiments in lab.
$ D7a-Plat-1
- Very well. Get to it.

// Dialogue 7b (Both workshop and lab ready, oil engine researched)
$ D7b-Bur-1
- Now we have everything ready and we can start production. We will be able to build only light reckon vehicles in this simple shop. Still, all our vehicles are better and sturdier than the Yanks crap.
$ D7b-Plat-1
- Very well. My congratulations, comrade Gorky. Now build each of you one of these.

! Laboratory
Laboratory
You have just constructed your first laboratory. Your can turn your people into scientists there - just send them in and press the "Change the profession button. Scientists can research new technologies inside laboratory and they can also act as medics, healing wounded characters in field. Just click the Heal icon (or press H) and then click the wounded character (if the character is dying (his health bar is red), you can simply right-click him with a scientist selected - healing will be the default command).

To start a research, select a laboratory and then click the Basic research button. You will then see which fields of exploration are available to you. Click one of them and research commences. If you have no scientist in laboratory (e.e. the laboratory is either empty or you have only characters of other professions inside), you will see flashing red icon "Missing scientist".

The first technology you should now research is "Oil power" and then "Oil engine". This will give you the ability to construct oil-powered vehicles in your workshop.

[Laboratory]
!

! Workshop
Workshop

You can now operate your first workshop. People can become mechanics here - this works like in other buildings. Mechanics are better drivers (a vehicle driven by a mechanic is faster and deals more damage to enemy than the one driven by, say, soldier). A mechanic is also able to repair a damaged vehicle: just click his Repair icon (or press R) and then click the damaged vehicle.

Only mechanics can operate workshop. If you try to build a vehicle and you have no mechanic inside (i.e. the workshop is either empty or only characters of other professions are in), you will se flashing red icon "Mechanic missing". Until you send some mechanic in, the production will not start.

A workshop can be upgraded to Factory which in turn can be improved by up to five Extensions. These can give you more construction options, but this upgrade is not available in this mission
[Workshop]
!

! BuildingVehicles
Building Vehicles
You can build vehicles in workshop. If you select it, you can see four drop-down lists: these correspond to four vehicle components - chassis, weapon, control system and engine. At present you have not much choice in constructing vehicles as you have only one available type of chassis, weapon and control system. You do not even have an engine until you research it in a laboratory.

In more advanced missions you will be able to select from more types of components and build many different types of vehicles.

Anyway, once you are satisfied with the vehicle design, just press the Construct Vehicle icon and production starts (presuming that there is a mechanic inside). You will also note that the amount of material in the base decreases. This material is consumed to build the vehicle. When you hover the mouse over Construct Vehicle icon, you will see hint telling you how much material and other resources the vehicle will cost.

// Dialogue 8 (Burlak or any of the player controlled men tries to leave base before the objective is fulfilled)
$ D8-Plat-1
- Hey, where are you going, comrade? I fear, your task is not finished here, yet. Return immediately to your job. (The question here is whether the game should force player to do so, I think better not)

// Dialogue 9 (Vehicle constructed)
$ D9-Bur-1
- Comrade major! We have achieved our planned production!
$ D9-Plat-1
- Very well, comrade. Now you can drive it to Kirov, they are waiting for it. Then return here and report to me.

! Driving
Driving vehicles

Now you have built vehicles, you can drive them. An empty vehicle cannot drive anywhere, you will also note that its side colour is dimmed. In order to be able to control the vehicle, you have to enter it first. Entering a vehicle is quite easy, just select a character and right-click a vehicle (you can also issue the "Move" command, with vehicle as its target). To get off vehicle, just click the "Get off" button on command panel.

You can select vehicles in the same manner as you do other units. You will note that contrary to human units, vehicles have not one, but three bars. The uppermost one (short green) is health bar of the driver. A human in vehicle is better protected against enemy fire than the one without, but he still takes some damage when in combat. The middle bar (longer green) is health bar of vehicle. Just like with humans, when you are in combat this bar will get shorter and turn yellow and then red. Once vehicle goes into red, it is unusable. The driver gets out automatically.
!

! Fuel
Refuelling vehicles

The lower bar (longer cyan) shows the level of fuel in the vehicle's tank. Your vehicles use combustion engine that consumes oil. As you drive around, level of fuel steadily decreases. To refuel the vehicle, just right-click a depot, a workshop (or factory) or oil rig. The vehicle will drive there and refuel automatically. When you happen to run dry far from your base, the driver gets out and you have two options: Either you can use a mechanic to push the vehicle back to base (just select the mechanic, right-click the vehicle, and issue commands to vehicles like usual) or you can use an engineer to bring oil to vehicle (select an engineer, click his "Transport" button, click the "Oil" button, click the depot where to take the oil and once the engineer has the canister in his hands, right-click the empty vehicle).
!

! Repair
Repairing vehicles

Any mechanic can repair a damaged vehicle. After combat it may be advantageous to order your mechanic to get out of his vehicle. He will automatically start repairing it.

- This vehicle looks perfect, I can't wait to see these twin machine guns in action.
$ D10-Kur-2
- This should give you the edge you need so the tragic accident like death of comrade Pokryshkin need not happen again. Now go about your duties.

- Yes, these vehicles are like second nature to us now. I think we'll be good at driving them too.
$ D12-Plat-2
- Very well. Now you can take out these vehicles for a ride. Go North and explore the unknown areas.

! Skills
Skills

As you know, you and your comrades can change your profession by entering appropriate buildings and taking appropriate equipment. Corresponding to the four professions there are four skills: combat, mechanical, engineering and science. The higher the skill, the better the character is at given profession - high combat skill allows you to deal more damage to enemy, high mechanical skill makes you produce better vehicles faster and also makes you a better driver, engineer with high skill will build better buildings faster and high science skill is guarantee of faster research and healing.

You can see the values of the skills of your men on the Info panel when you select them as a light dots appearing right to their portrait. You will note that the skill corresponding to the current profession is doubled. That takes into account that the man has appropriate kit for his mission. This means that e.g. a mechanic with mechanical skill 2 will drive a vehicle as effectively as let's say soldier with mechanical skill 4.
