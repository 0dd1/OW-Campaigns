// Dialogue Briefing 
$ DBriefing-Bur-1
- What have you discovered comrades?
$ DBriefing-RSol1-1
- A large Arabian base to the west of the motherlode. They call it New Samarkand. Seems pretty strong, we saw half a dozen sheikhs.
$ DBriefing-RSol2-1
- We observed increased American activity in the North.
$ DBriefing-Bur-2
- So, before we can take the site we need to secure the area. I'll take a group and do reconnaissance myself.

// Dialogue Start

// Dialogue LegionChallengeFarmer 
$ DLegionChallengeFarmer-Bur-1
- (into radio) This is Yuri Gorky, calling Robert Farmer. You are a thieving bastard and you will die!
$ DLegionChallengeFarmer-Frm-1
- You didn't pay us a bonus so we took it ourselves Burlak! Not that we are selfish about it. We'll share what we have with our American friends.
$ DLegionChallengeFarmer-Bur-2
- You are scum...
$ DLegionChallengeFarmer-Frm-2
- Say what you want. We'll be alive and you won't. The Americans have developed a Siberite bomb and when we hand them these notes, maybe they'll let us watch when they drop it on you. Nice knowing you commander.

$ DContam-Sci1-1
- Comrade major, this mine is giving off dangerous radiation. Anyone who goes near is burnt.
$ DContam-Bur-1
- So what's causing it?
$ DContam-Sci1-2
- We're trying to find out. But I think it must have been caused deliberately....

// Dialogue BehemothTechno (BehemothSeen = True)
$ DBehemothTechno-Bur-1
- You remember the vehicle Platonov tried to use? What do you think? Can we develop it here to use against the Arabs?
$ DBehemothTechno-Pty-1
- It's not a problem for Soviet scientists. We just need a weapon lab.
$ DBehemothTechno-Sci-1
- Provide us a weapon lab and we'll see what we can do.
$ DBehemothTechno-FSci1-1
- Provide us a weapon lab and we'll see what we can do.
$ DBehemothTechno-Bur-2

$ DBehemothTechno-FSci1-2
- I've been thinking of a moving fortress. Imagine a vehicle as big as a house, rolling forward, unstoppable, crushing its enemies beneath it.

// Dialogue BehemothComplete 
$ DBehemothComplete-Sci-1
- Comrade Burlak, design of the moving fortress is complete. We call it Behemoth. Engineers must construct it outside factories.
$ DBehemothComplete-Sci-1a
- Because of the size it is very slow. We have 12 computers to control it, but still they can't deal with driving, so you have to navigate carefully.
$ DBehemothComplete-Sci-1b
- It can only deal with small slopes. But believe me, comrade Burlak, no weapon will stop it. If we can get it to that base we will see it flattened in moments!
