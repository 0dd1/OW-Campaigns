% Burlak made the decision to join the Alliance. Now they must plan their escape in total secrecy. If they are discovered there will be no mercy.

// Dialogue  

// Dialogue Start (in Bluekher)
$ DStart-Gos-1
- I'm so glad you're with us, Burlak. Not many soldiers would understand our goals.
$ DStart-Bur-1
- Maybe more than you think. I shall try to bring more with me.
$ DStart-Gos-2
- You must hurry then. We plan to leave in the morning.
$ DStart-Bur-2
- Thanks for the warning!
$ DStart-Gos-3
- We will need time to get away. Bringing the Artefact is going to slow us down.
$ DStart-Bur-3
- Maybe I can lure the guards away. Which way will be heading?
$ DStart-Gos-4
- Straight to the North, where we are meeting Peter Roth, the American scientist.
$ DStart-Bur-4
- OK. There are marshes like a maze to the North, which could be useful. I'll get some men I can trust to build a small encampment to the north-east. I'll lure the pursuers there and this should give you time to make the escape.
$ DStart-Gos-5
- Thank you Burlak. Until tomorrow.

// Dialogue Platonov (start - Burlak is within base, Masha is nearby)
$ DPlatonov-Rsol1-1

$ DPlatonov-Rsol1-2
- We just need to ask a few questions. You'll be back soon.
$ DPlatonov-Bur-2
- No problem. I just have to do something first. (enters Masha)
$ DPlatonov-Rsol1-3
- What is it you need to do comrade?
$ DPlatonov-Bur-3
- Blow your ass away! (Burlak shoots)
$ DPlatonov-Rsol1-4
- Aaargh!
$ DPlatonov-Pla-4
- I knew it Gorky! You are imperialist agent! You will not live!
$ DPlatonov-Pla-4a
- Marshal Platonov calling all units! All units! Zionistic agent Yuri Gorky is escaping! Stop him! Whatever it takes. He must not escape!
