- Company, Atten-TION!
$ D1i-Off2-1
- Assemble groups: four soldiers, two technicians, one medic. 
$ D1i-Off1-2
- Company, re-GROUP!
$ D1i-Off2-2
- Remember your codename. Immediately you arrive, free the area for your comrades. Make contact with marshal Yashin, call sign Eagle, and wait further orders.
$ D1i-Off1-3
- Company, forward-MARCH!
$ D1-Bur-1
- So what’s different here? Same wasteland as always. (A beat. Burlak moves aside quickly.)
$ D1-Bur-1a
- Where are others? I should not be alone. (into radio) Hello, this Robin 5, Robin 5 calling Eagle. Do you read me? (static over radio)
$ D1-Bur-1b
- This is not good. Either Radio is broken or there’s nobody home. Better take a look around; see if any American bastards are near by.
$ DWaterfall-Bur-1
- Incredible. It was worth trip to see this.
$ DCorpse-Bur-1
- Death is not a pretty sight. Worse than a Moscow butcher’s shop!  If I die here I hope it is swift. 
$ D2-Bur-1
- Engels told us work plays big part in humanising the Ape. These guys must have lot of hard labour coming!
$ D2-Bur-1a
- [Apeman attacks him] Aggressive bastards! Better be careful.
$ D2a-Bur-1
- [it is he] Look, the Apeman had our radio! What’s left of it.
$ D2a-Bel-1
- [it is he] The bastard had our radio. I wish we’d killed him more slowly.
$ D2a-Kir-1
- [it is he] Looks like we killed one of their engineers! He’s taken our radio to pieces.
$ D2a-RSol1-1
- [it is he] Hey, look. This Apeman had our army radio. 
$ D2a-RFSol1-1
- [it is he] No wonder we couldn’t make contact, these guys have made a jigsaw of our radio.
$ D2a-Gny-1
- [Gnyevko present] Look! This used to be my radio. It’s crushed!
$ D2a-Bur-2
- [Gnyevko not found] He must have taken it from one of our men. Maybe they are nearby, maybe alive. 
$ D3-Bur-1
- [Burlak did not meet Pokryshkin: alt a1] Greetings comrade. What is your name?
$ D3-RSol1-1
- [Burlak met Pokryshkin: alt a2] Greetings comrade. What is your name?
$ D3-RFSol1-1
- [Burlak met Pokryshkin: alt a2] Greetings comrade. What is your name?
$ D3-Gny-1
- Corporal Gnyevko, 21st platoon, call sign Sparrow 3. I appeared here couple of days ago, the Apes attacked me and took kit. You’re first person I see.
$ D3-Bur-2
- [killed Apeman] I think it was the same ape who attacked me. He won’t do it again! I found your radio, it’s had a few modifications by the Apeman I’m afraid.
$ D3-Bur-2a
- [soldiers killed Apeman] We killed an Ape that had some kit. Your radio was in pieces comrade. 
$ D3-Bur-2b
- My name is Yuri Ivanovich Gorky, but I am known as Burlak.
$ D3-Bur-2c
- [alt a1] My radio’s broken. I think we should go together. That way is better chance to stay alive. 
$ D3-Bur-2d
- [present, Gladstone not attacked, alt a2] Come with us. I just arrived also, but these guys know what’s going on.
$ D3-Bur-2e
- [present, Gladstone attacked, alt a3] Come with us, these guys know where to find the base.
$ D3-RSol1-2
- [otherwise, alt a2 or alt a3] All right, come with me. We are returning to our base.
$ D3-RFSol1-2
- [otherwise, alt a2 or alt a3] All right, come with me. We are returning to our base.
$ D3-Gny-2
- [alt a1] Up to you, Burlak. Lead the way.
$ D3-Gny-2a
- [alt a2 or alt a3] This is good news. I am really sick of hiding from big monkey bastards. Lead the way.
$ D4-Pok-1
- Halt! Who are you?
$ D4-Gny-1
- [present] Corporal Gnyevko, 21st platoon, call sign Sparrow 3. (Turns Pokryshkin's colour).
$ D4-Pok-2
- [Burlak too far] Welcome to Eden! 
$ D4-Gny-2
- [reply] There is one of our mechanics in area, his radio is broken…
$ D4-Pok-3
- [reply] We heard materialisation boom. We'll wait for him.
$ D4-Gny-3
- [reply, when Burlak really arrives] This is him.
$ D4-Bur-3
- Mechanic 3rd class, Yuri I. Gorky. Call sign Robin 5...
$ D4-Pok-4
- Forget call sign my friend. Forget everything Red Army taught you. This not the place for rules. I am lieutenant Mikhail Vasilyevich Pokryshkin...
$ D4-Bur-4
- What the hell was that?
$ D4-Pok-5
- Ssssh… wait…
$ D4-Sol1-5
- (over radio) Lieutenant Charles Brown calling Alpha. Alpha do you read me?
$ D4-Pok-6
- Now you will learn little Robin!
$ D4-Pok-6a
- (into radio – with fake American accent) We read you loud and clear Brown. Head east and find a group of three trees on a hilltop. We’ll send search party to meet you. 
$ D4-Bur-6
- What’s going on here?
$ D4-Pok-7
- Come with us and you will find out.
$ DSplit-Pok-1
- Where are you going, Gorky? I told you to stick with us!
$ DSplit-Bur-1
- My apologies Lieutenant. (in-game video, Burlak walks back to Pokryshkin)
$ DAttack-Pok-1
- You’re eithermad or on the wrong side Gorky. Either way we cannot let you live. Kill him! (All Russians attack Burlak)
$ D5-Sol1-1
- Hi there guys...
$ D5-Pok-1
- Get Yankee bastard! (Russians open fire at American)
$ D5-Sol1-2
- Oh my God! No...Please! (dies)
$ D5-Bur-2
- This is what you call war here?
$ D5-Pok-2
- We take them out before they know who we are. We can’t allow them to make contact.
$ D5-Bel-2
- Easy pickings comrade! And a lot of fun. Did you see, he pissed himself for real. Yellow bastard!
$ D5-Pok-3
- I don't find it amusing, Belkov. But if they want to steal what is ours, they can expect nothing else.
$ D5-Gny-3
- [present] This isn't war. It's nothing but murder!
$ D5-Bur-3
- It is not pleasant but I see it is necessary. We can’t afford to lose here. If they were afraid to die they should never have come.
$ D6-Pok-1
- So, now we can head back to S. M. Kirov base.
$ D6-Bur-1
- Construction has taken place already?
$ D6-Pok-2
- There has been time. The TAWAR does not deliver us here in order that we left. Could be three years late or early, no-one knows.
$ D6-Bel-2
- And different places… I travelled two days before I saw another human.
$ D6-Bur-2
- So how long have other comrades been here? 
$ D6-Pok-3
- The first to arrive was general Morozov, on 7th November, last year – today, it's March 13, year two of the New Reckoning, or 2 NR. Morozov founded base V. I. Lenin and then....
$ D6-Kur-3
- (over radio) Mikhail, there are Yanks North of you. Take your men, find the Americans and kill them.
$ D6-Pok-4
- (into radio) Roger, Kirov. On our way.
$ D6-Bel-4
- At last, some action! I hope it’s not too easy!
$ D7-Pok-1
- So here it is. Ready your guns and charge!
$ D7-FSol1-1
- (English, with Native titles) Tim, there are Russians attacking me…What? I think so...
$ D7a-Bel-1
- (desperate) Comrade Pokryshkin!
$ D7a-RSol1-1
- Retreat everybody! We have no chance here!
$ D7a-FSol1-1
- (English, with Native titles) OK, Tim, they’re on the run.
$ D7b-Bel-1
- What the hell should we do now?
$ D7b-FSol1-1
- Obviously, frontal attack is not an option.
$ D7b-Bel-2
- We cannot win! Comrade Pokryshkin was a great soldier.
$ D7b-RSol1-2
- Pokryshkin was commander. Without him we must return to Kirov for orders.
$ D7b-Bel-3
- [Burlak too far] You are right comrade. But we should wait for Burlak, the mechanic.
$ D7b-Bel-3a
- [Burlak returns] He is here! Keep moving Burlak, we are returning to Kirov.
$ D7b-Bur-3
- What for? We have our orders comrade: destroy the base. 
$ D7b-Bel-4
- We have tried and failed!
$ D7b-Bur-4
- We need a better way to attack.
$ D7b-Bel-5
- Burlak!
$ D7b-FSol1-5
- He may be right, we can examine options. Maybe take cover behind trees.
$ D7b-Bel-6
- Are you both crazy? We need reinforcements!
$ D7b-Bur-6
- You are the one who wanted a fight and all we face is a woman and a pile of sandbags. Is that too hard for you ?
$ D7b-RSol1-6
- Burlak is right. We can take it. Let's kick some Yankee ass! 
$ D8-FSol1-1
- (English, with Native titles) Quick, Tim, the Russians are back!
$ D8-Glad-1
- Hold on, I’ll send the Apemen to help you!
$ D8-Bur-1
- (Apeman counterattack) Watch out! Hit the big monkeys!
$ D8-FSol1-2
- [cannot attack from breastwork] (English, with Native titles) Damn! The bastards are hiding behind the trees. I can't hit them from here.
$ D8-FSol1-2a
- [if bunker goes to red] (English, with Native titles) Damned commies.
$ D8-Glad-2
- [reply] (English, with Native titles) Our situation’s desperate. We have to run for it.
$ D8-Bur-2
- After him! He is the commander!
$ D9-Bur-1
- [Gladstone dead, FASoldier dead] Well done, friends. We have cleared the vermin.
$ D9-Bur-1a
- [Gladstone escaped, FASoldier dead] It is good we have the woman, but we should not have lost their commander.
$ D9-Bur-1b
- [Gladstone dead, FASoldier escaped] The woman who shot Pokryshkin has escaped this time, but their commander has paid!
$ D9-Bur-1c
- [Gladstone escaped, FASoldier escaped] We should not have lost them! Those dogs killed Pokryshkin. One day they must pay!
$ D10-Bur-1
- We have cleared our debt, now we can return with our heads held high. Do any of you know how to get back to the V. I. Lenin base?
$ D10-Bel-1
- [alive] You were right comrade! We succeeded !
$ D10-Bel-1a
- [reply] V. I. Lenin is main base, south of here. But S. M. Kirov is much nearer. To the East. I can take us there.
$ D10-RSol1-1
- [otherwise] V. I. Lenin is main base. But we from S. M. Kirov, East of here. I can take us.
$ D10-Bur-2
- Let’s go then.
$ D11a-Kir-1
- Thank God! I am comrade Kirilenkova, medic from platoon 6?
$ D11a-Bel-1
- Hey, it’s me, Belkov, we were in same platoon.
$ D11a-Kir-2
- Where are the others?
$ D11a-Bel-2
- We can explain later. Now we have to move.
$ D11a-RSol1-2
- Later we tell you everything. Come with us.
$ D11a-RFSol1-2
- Later we tell you everything. Come with us.
$ D11b-Kir-1
- To all... This is Kirilenkova, call sign Grouse 4. Can you hear me anybody? Where are you?
$ D11b-Bel-1
- [alive] This is a medic from our platoon!
$ D11b-Bel-1a
- [cont] We read you. Tell us your position.
$ D11b-RSol1-1
- [var a1] We read you. Tell us your position.
$ D11b-RFSol1-1
- [var a2] We read you. Tell us your position.
$ D11b1-Kir-1
- There is a lake and a waterfall here. And large monkeys. They grow violent and I think they decide to attack me.
$ D11b1-Bur-1
- [saw aggressive Apemen] I know where this could be. I had same problem with Apes.
$ D11b1-Bur-1a
- [else] A waterfall? I may know where this place is.
$ D11b1-Bel-1
- [alive] Stand by, Kirilenkova, we are coming for you. Find somewhere you can defend yourself.
$ D11b1-RSol1-1
- [var a1] Stand by, Kirilenkova, we are coming for you..
$ D11b1-RFSol1-1
- [var a2] Stand by, we are coming for you..
$ D11b2-Kir-1
- I don't know. There is some lake… and a waterfall.
$ D11b2-Bel-1
- [alive] Stand by, Kirilenkova, we know where it is and we are coming for you.
$ D11c-Kir-1
- What is happening here? Why do we not arrive in platoons?
$ D11c-Bur-1
- The TAWAR doesn’t work as we thought. We’ll explain at the base. But first we have to get there!
$ D12-Bel-1
- [present] This road leads to Kirov. I'm looking forward to glass of vodka! Maybe a bottle!
$ D12-RSol1-1
- [else] This road leads to Kirov.
$ D12-Bur-1
- We should take a look around. The guy who lost the radio could still be out here.
$ D12-Bel-2
- [present to killing of Ape] This is hopeless, that Ape could have had the radio for years.
